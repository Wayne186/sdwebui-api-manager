## AAM - AnyLoRA Anime Mix - Anime Screencap Style Model
suggested settings:

Set the ETA Noise Seed Delta (ENSD) to 31337

Set CLIP Skip to 2

DISABLE face restore. It's terrible, never use it

Use negative prompts and embeddings that don't ruin the style

Use AnimeVideo or Foolhardy as upscalers. If you know what to do, Latent makes an interesting effect (see the first example and the Miku one)

(optional to reproduce some results) Set "Do not make DPM++ SDE deterministic across different batch sizes." Only my old images use that.
(this setting is not actually good, so I'm gonna disable it, but might be the reason some results are different)
